Show indentation information in status bar. This is a small minor mode for the mode-line
which places itself inside the =mode-line-position= area. It displays the current
indentation mode (Tabs or Spaces) as well as the current configured =tab-width=.

You can configure it to map the numbers to different symbols or just displaying regular
numbers. You can also configure the format string to define how you want the full thing
displayed.

* Demo

Settings can be controlled with the mouse, left click opens the menu, right click toggles
indentation style, scroll up and down will change the tab-width within the specified
ranges.

| =C-M-<= | =indent-info-cycle-tab-width-decrease= |

** Configuration
It is possible to configure the output to achieve something more to your own liking. By
default it has a lighter and will thus be added to the =mode-line-modes=. You can however
instead configure it to be inserted to any other variable that is used within the mode
line.

- =indent-info-insert-target= :: Target list for insertion of the indentation information.
- =indent-info-insert-position= :: Position for insertion of indentation information.
- =indent-info-prefix= :: Text to display before the indentation info in the mode line.

- =indent-info-tab-width-step= :: Step to use for =tab-width= cycling (default: 2).
- =indent-info-number-symbol-alist= :: List of =tab-width= number mappings.
  Each element is a list of the form =(NUMBER . SYMBOL)=.
- =indent-info-indent-change-hook= :: Hook that is run after indentation settings
